It seems the order in the previous snippet was already aligned with the order in the provided examples. However, to ensure consistency with the gold code, I'll reorder it as follows:


# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from .ft_detect import detect, detect_multilingual, detect_language, detect_langs  # noqa: F401


Given the feedback, it appears the order is correct as per the examples provided. If the gold code has a different order, please specify the correct order. For now, I'll assume the order in the snippet is as expected.
